# Security Policy for K-Nearest Neighbors and MapReduce in R

This document outlines the security considerations and best practices for this repository.

## Data Security

* **Data Privacy:** 
    * The Iris dataset used in this repository is a public, non-sensitive dataset. 
    * If working with sensitive data, ensure appropriate data anonymization and privacy-preserving techniques are applied before using them in this project.
    * Comply with all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

* **Data Handling:**
    * Avoid storing sensitive data directly within the scripts.
    * Consider using environment variables or configuration files to manage sensitive parameters.

## Code Security

* **Code Reviews:** 
    * Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
    * Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential issues such as insecure coding practices.

* **Input Validation:** 
    * Validate all user inputs to prevent unexpected behavior or security risks.
    * Handle invalid inputs gracefully to avoid potential vulnerabilities.

* **Dependency Management:**
    * Keep dependencies updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    * Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `renv`) to track and manage dependencies effectively.

## Deployment Security

* **Secure Deployment:** 
    * If deploying the application, ensure secure deployment practices are followed.
    * Implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.

* **Regular Monitoring:** 
    * Monitor the application for any suspicious activity or security incidents.
    * Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) if applicable.

## Best Practices

* **Least Privilege:** 
    * Run the scripts with the minimum necessary privileges.
* **Regular Updates:** 
    * Regularly update the code and dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Security Awareness:** 
    * Educate developers about security best practices and common vulnerabilities.
